   "description": "I was looking for someone to remodel my old, dated winding stairs (remove shag carpet, replace pickets) to match with the rest of my new renovated town home and I needed it done on a specific schedule. Well, Lautaro really came through. He was professional and highly responsive from the first moment we connected and that professionalism and responsiveness carried through to the end. Im pretty detail oriented and even when I asked him to do some very minor touch ups he was so responsive and didnt make me feel like I was being unreasonable or wasting his time. He gave me a ton of confidence from the beginning and ended up delivering the project on time, on budget and most importantly on quality - the stairs are fabulous and exactly what I had envisioned. I would highly recommend Lautaro and Piacentini Painting Services.",

I liked how he meant business right from when he entered into my house from the first day of the job. He worked very hard until the job was completely finished. He was organized with bringing equipment into, and out from my home. He prepped everything very well to make sure none of the floors were left with paint drips at the end of the job. Would highly recommend to anyone.",
